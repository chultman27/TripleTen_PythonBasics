# TripleTen_PythonBasics
Project for TripleTen Sprint1. Investigating Basic Python techniques.

The aim of this project is to investigate how the number of votes a title receives from IMDb users impacts its ratings. The assumption is that highly-rated shows released during the “Golden Age” of television also have the most votes.
